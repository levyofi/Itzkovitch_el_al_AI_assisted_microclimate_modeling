Microclimates play a vital role in shaping the behavior and ecological dynamics of organisms. To these days, remote sensing coupled with ground-temperature physically-modeling has emerged as a common approach to detect and characterize microclimates. However, physical models are subject to certain limitations that can hinder their accuracy. In the current study, we offer a novel framework that combines statistical modeling with deterministic physical predictions to achieve more precise ground-temperature modeling. By integrating statistical methods into our modeling approach, we successfully mitigated the prediction errors that present in a physical deterministic model. We identified several critical parameters that significantly influenced the accuracy of deterministic predictions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that impact microclimate detection and enable more refined modeling studies in the future.

## Abstract:

Microclimates are essential for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behavior, physiology, and species distributions. Traditional approaches for modeling ground temperatures in microhabitats rely on physical models informed by remote sensing data; however, these models often exhibit significant biases due to unaccounted environmental factors. In this study, we developed a framework that combines drone-based microclimate mapping with machine learning to correct prediction errors in a physical ground-temperature model. Our machine learning model effectively reduced biases across diverse environmental conditions, identifying key factors—such as solar radiation, vegetation cover, and skyview—that contribute to model inaccuracies. By integrating these corrections, we achieved more accurate ground-temperature predictions, enhancing our capacity to map microclimates at fine spatial scales. This hybrid modeling approach offers a powerful tool for ecologists, conservationists, and land managers seeking to better understand microclimatic effects on biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a changing climate.

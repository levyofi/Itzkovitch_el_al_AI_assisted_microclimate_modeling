# Codes
The codes consist of three parts/steps:
## Step 1 - Physical framework
`Physical framework folder.`
- how to create the data script (in R).
- physical model script (in julia).
## Step 2 - Statistical framework
`Statistical framework folder.`

The machine  learning model. 
- random forest model script (in python).
## Step 3 - Analysis and figures
`Figures folder.`
- A script for each figure in the main text and supplementary (in both R and python).

## Environment setups
Three environments were set for this codes:
**`R:`**
No ibraries should be downloaded.

R version should be 2.9.1 or lower, in order to use rgdal package.
**`Julia:`**
Many packages are downloaded during the script. However, all of them are downloaded automatically at the begining of the script.
**`Python:`**
A pre-downloaded packages were used in python.

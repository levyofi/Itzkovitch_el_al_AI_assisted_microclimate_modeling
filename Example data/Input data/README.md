### Here attached input maps for the model before ML to run.
Five files are used to generate physical model predictions:
- `TGI.tif:` vegetation index map.
- `height.tif`
- `shade.tif:` a binary map indicates if a pixel is in shade or sun.
- `skyview.tif`
- `real_solar.tif`

Also, two files are used for validation process:
- `IR.tif:` real temperature recorded using infrared camera.
- `RGB.tif:` for visualization

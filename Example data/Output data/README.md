### Here are the data generated by the models:
- `Physical_prediction.tif:` a file contains the prediction from the physical model (before ML).
- `correction_map.npy:` a numpy file contains the prediction from the random forest model (after ML).

  
These two files did not refer as prediction error maps, but as the raw predictions made by both models.
